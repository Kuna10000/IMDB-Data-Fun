# IMDB-Data-Fun
 Scraping and displaying imdb for fun
 
## Used python and the beautiful soup library to web scrape 28,000 tv shows and 73,000 movies data from the IMDB website. Used that data to make a visualization in PowerBi that allows the user to query for movies or tv shows based on region, genre, rating, etc and shows insights about the data.
