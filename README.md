# IMDB-Data-Fun
Used python and the beautiful soup library to web scrape 28,000 tv shows and 73,000 movies data from the IMDB website. Used that data to make a visualization in PowerBi that allows the user to query for movies or tv shows based on region, genre, rating, etc and shows insights about the data.

###Purpose
My friends and I love cinema and are always looking for new things to watch. The common problem we would come across is finding a movie we want to watch. Finding movies of high value in different genres and regions was always a difficult thing to do for us as well as finding something that was the right length of the day. 
The desire was for a fast way to query for movies or tvshows based on region, genre, length, and rating.
